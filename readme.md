## L3 Accelerator Assessment

For the coding of each section, we drive and they navigate. We shouldn't need to run the code, since the problems are very straightforward. We can just review the code. (nothing is setup to run the code except for the dsa question which can be run with `node dsa.js`)

### DSA
We give them the dsa question, findMostFrequent. [dsa.js](dsa.js)

### Express
We give them the express question, dsaController.js. This extends from the dsa question. [dsaController.js](dsaController.js)

### React
We give them the react question, Pokemon.jsx. [Pokemon.jsx](Pokemon.jsx)
