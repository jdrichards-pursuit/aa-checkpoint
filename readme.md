## L3 Accelerator Assessment

### Instructions

**Total time: 45 minutes**
For the coding of each section, the interviewer drives and the candidate navigates. We shouldn't need to run the code, since the problems are very straightforward. We can just review the code. (there is no setup to run the code except for the dsa question which can be run with `node dsa.js`)

### DSA (15 minutes)
We give them the dsa question, findMostFrequent, located at [dsa.js](dsa.js)

### Express (15 minutes)
We give them the ExpressJS question, dsaController.js. This extends from the dsa question located at [dsaController.js](dsaController.js)

### React (15 minutes)
We give them the React question located at [Pokemon.jsx](Pokemon.jsx)
