## Evaluation Guidelines for Interviewer

### Real-time Assessment Tips

1. Use progressive prompting:
   - Start with "Can you walk me through your thinking?"
   - Follow up with "What edge cases should we consider?"
   - Note when prompting was required

2. Communication Markers:
   - Proactive explanation vs. prompted
   - Technical vocabulary usage
   - Question quality
   - Code narration while typing

3. Red Flags (-2 points each):
   - Silent coding without explanation
   - Skipping planning phase
   - Unable to explain code choices
   - Dismissive of edge cases

## Total Score: 50 points

- DSA: 20 points (40%)
- Express: 15 points (30%)
- React: 15 points (30%)

## Minimum Passing Score: 35 points (Proficient level)
